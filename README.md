# golfhub

Have you ever showed up to your tee time only to be paired with two 80 year old men, both named Jim? If you haven't, take my word, it's not fun. Golfhub is a web application that takes the guess work out of finding a 4 man team to golf with. Golfhub allows golfers to find golf groups before they even hit the course. This will prevent younger golfers from getting paired with people they simply can't connect with... aka boomers.
